# k8sScw.com

Setup sancapweather.com in a kubernetes cluster as deployment named scwcom; expose as service scwcom; connect to the internet as sancapweather.com through an ingress called scwcom-ingress. The ambientweather.net server collects the realtime data from the weather station in Sanibel.  The sancapweather.com uses apis from ambientweather to get the realtime data and render it... there is not volume storage for this application.

Source image [InstallSCW.com](https://github.com/jkozik/InstallSCW.com)

# build image, put on docker hub
SanCapWeather.com is running in a docker container on my host, directly -- not in a VM.  To make it run in my kubernetes cluster, I need to push the image to my dockerhub repository.  The kubernetes deployment resource has an "image" field that triggers a pull of this image from dockerhub.

## Deploy
Clone the yaml files in this repository.  One can apply them one at a time, but it works fine to apply them all at once.  On the kubectl host, run the following to deploy all in one command:
```
[jkozik@dell2 ~]$ git clone https://github.com/jkozik/k8sScw.com

## HomeLAN NATing from external IP address / port 80 to cluster's LAN address and ingress controller's port number.
So, on my home LAN http://192.168.100.174:30410 is where incoming web traffic enters.  The ingress controller parses for sancapweather.com and redirects the traffic to the scwcom service. I have an external IP address for my home LAN that gets NAT'd by my home router to 192.168.100.174.  On that NAT box, I map port 80 to port 30410. As you can see from the get ingress command, I also am running a wordpress application with another URL, but also mapped to the same IP address and port number.  The ingress control does a reverse proxy function and splits the wordpress traffic off to the nginx-wordpress-ingress resource.
